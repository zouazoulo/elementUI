        'text': "The impact of university rankings has driven scholars to increase productivity, and expanding collaboration has dramatically changed the publishing patterns in the academic publication system. The aim of this study was to develop a scholar classification scheme from publication patterns in academic science. Classification schemes are ways of describing groups that display different clusters of behaviors, approaches, or perspectives, and useful in the development of typologies. In this research, sample data are selected from three representative universities, considered a leading university, a middle‐tier university, and a noncomprehensive university. A final set of 11,427 effective scholars and their 284,128 journal publication records were used to develop the classification scheme via cluster analysis. The results identify six types of scholars, labeled as: singleton (8%), small‐team low performer (16%), small‐team high performer (17%), big‐team strategist (22%), free‐style follower (21%), and life‐time warrior (17%). These six scholar types demonstrate different approaches to publishing that can be used to understand both individual and research team performance across different institutional settings. Additionally, possible future work was identified that uses the scholar classification scheme to define the behavior for agents in an agent‐based model to simulate the strategic‐behavior‐driven academic publication system",
